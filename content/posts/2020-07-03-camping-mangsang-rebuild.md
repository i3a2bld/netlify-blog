My first time to visit there was when I visited there to see one of my friends in the military in the summer of 1996. At that time I was a third-year-university-student wondering whether to join the military to take the military responsibility or to keep studying.As a Korean man it is still for us mandatory as responsibility of being Korean man to serve the army for about 2 years. It was for me 26 months. It is still difficulit for me to make a descion about right way in my life now as well as in the past.
