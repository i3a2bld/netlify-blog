> Mangsang Auto Camping Repsort is closed on August 15th, 2020 in accordance with its restroration plan and the re-opening date will be announced later. The reason why Mangsang Auto Camping Resort is required to restore is that it was almost burned down by the forest fire last year.

[DONGHAE](http://www.dh.go.kr/english/) is located in the east region of South Korea and faces the east sea of Korea.  

My first time to visit there was when I visited there to see one of my friends in the military in the summer of 1996. At that time I was a third-year-university-student wondering whether to join the military to take the military responsibility or to keep studying.As a Korean man it is still for us mandatory as responsibility of being Korean man to serve the army for about 2 years. It was for me 26 months. It is still difficulit for me to make a descion about right way in my life now as well as in the past.
