> A boy dreaming establishing an electronic company making a radio such as SONY and AIWA decided to make a company CI when he was a high school student who had a big interest in philosophy. He thought the company CI should look like our life. Birth, Living, and death.It was after class in the class room he just wrote "I was born and I live and I will die." He made it as I3A2BLD and decided to study in electronics in the university. Time goes by the boy became middle-aged. What now he can do and what he accomplished?
